\begin{frame}{Conclusions and Future Works}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed \CPD{}s as heuristic functions for dynamic settings where costs can only increase;
        \item described a new algorithm, \CPDSearch{} which can be used in both optimal and anytime context;
        \item experimentally-evaluated \CPDSearch{} performances shows gain in both contexts over previous state-of-the-art algorithms (\ALT{} and \AWA{});
        \item \textbf{Future Work}: explore \CPD{} usage in Multi-Agent Path Finding context and in dynamically changing edge costs over time.
