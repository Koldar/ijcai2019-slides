\begin{frame}{Conclusions and Future Works}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed \CPD{}s as heuristic functions for dynamic settings where costs can only increase;
        \medskip
        \item developed a new algorithm, \CPDSearch{} which can be used in both optimal and anytime context;
        \medskip
        \item Experimental analysis performances showing improvements \wrt{} state-of-the-art (\ALT{} and \AWA{});
        \medskip
        \item \textbf{Future Work} includes explore \CPD{} usage in Multi-Agent Path Finding context.
